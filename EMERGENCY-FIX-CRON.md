# ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY FIX - Disable Cron Jobs Temporarily

## Why:
The cron jobs are running too frequently (every 6-12 mins) and causing:
- Polygon API rate limit (429 errors)
- Circuit breaker activation
- App instability

## How to Fix:

### Option 1: Disable in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/andrew-halls-projects-c98040e4/toption-app/settings/cron-jobs
2. Click "Disabled" toggle at the top
3. This stops ALL cron jobs from running

### Option 2: Comment Out Cron Routes (Code Fix)
```bash
cd /Users/andyhall/virtera/toption-trading-app

# Rename cron files to disable them
mv src/app/api/cron/proper-scan/route.ts src/app/api/cron/proper-scan/route.ts.disabled

git add .
git commit -m "fix: Temporarily disable cron jobs to prevent API rate limiting"
git push origin main
```

## After Fixing:
- App will stop auto-scanning
- Users can manually trigger scans
- Polygon API will stop getting hammered
- 429 errors will stop

## When to Re-enable:
After we implement:
- Proper rate limiting (1 request per 5 seconds minimum)
- Better caching (cache for 30 minutes, not 5)
- Manual scan buttons instead of auto-cron

**DO THIS FIRST!** Then move to Phase 2.
