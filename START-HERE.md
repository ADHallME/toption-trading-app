```

cd /Users/andyhall/virtera/toption-trading-app

git remote add origin https://github.com/ADHallME/toption-trading-app.git
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### "Deployment failed"
1. Check Vercel logs
2. Verify env vars set
3. Check for TypeScript errors
4. Try local build: `npm run build`

### "Database migration error"

2. **Check git status first** - know what's been committed
3. **Verify env vars** - most issues come from missing credentials
4. **Test locally before deploying** - faster iteration
