## 🎯 FILES TO DELETE

### Polygon Clients (5 files)

**Keep This One:**
- ✅ `src/lib/polygon/properClient.ts` (Oct 14, 2025 - Most recent)

**Delete These:**
1. ❌ `src/lib/polygon/api-client.ts`
2. ❌ `src/lib/polygon/market-client.ts`
3. ❌ `src/lib/polygon/unified-client.ts`
4. ❌ `src/lib/polygon/client.ts`
5. ❌ `src/lib/polygon/enhanced-client.ts`

**Reasoning:** Multiple attempts at creating the Polygon client, properClient.ts is the most recent and is correctly imported everywhere.

---

### Scanners (3 files)

**Keep This One:**
- ✅ `src/lib/server/properScanner.ts` (Oct 14, 2025 - Most recent)

**Delete These:**
1. ❌ `src/lib/scanner/market-scanner.ts`
2. ❌ `src/lib/scanner/market-scanner-fixed.ts`
3. ❌ `src/lib/scanner/market-scanner-simple.ts`

**Reasoning:** Multiple iterations trying to fix scanner issues, properScanner.ts is the final version and is correctly imported.

---

### Dashboard Components (1 file)

**Keep This One:**
- ✅ `src/components/dashboard/EnhancedOverview.tsx` (Oct 14, 2025 - Current version)

**Delete This:**
1. ❌ `src/components/dashboard/EnhancedOverviewV2.tsx`

**Reasoning:** V2 was an attempted improvement but was abandoned. Current version (no suffix) is the active one and had a bad import that was fixed.

---

## 📊 FILES TO KEEP (Active Codebase)

### Polygon Files (Keep All):
- ✅ `properClient.ts` - **PRIMARY POLYGON CLIENT**
- ✅ `optionsSnapshot.ts` - Options data fetching
- ✅ `allTickers.ts` - Full ticker list
- ✅ `liquidTickers.ts` - Filtered liquid tickers
- ✅ `ticker-search.ts` - Search functionality
- ✅ `websocket.ts` - WebSocket support
- ✅ `sample-data.ts` - Test data

### Server Files (Keep All):
- ✅ `properScanner.ts` - **PRIMARY SCANNER**
- ✅ `opportunityScanner.ts` - Opportunity detection
- ✅ `rollingRefreshScanner.ts` - Background refresh

### Dashboard Files (Keep Active):
- ✅ `EnhancedOverview.tsx` - **PRIMARY DASHBOARD**
- (Plus 40+ other active dashboard components)

---

## 🚀 EXECUTION PLAN

### Step 1: Run Cleanup Script
```bash
cd /Users/andyhall/virtera/toption-trading-app
chmod +x cleanup-duplicates.sh
./cleanup-duplicates.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Deletion
```bash
# Check polygon directory (should only see 7 files)
ls -la src/lib/polygon/

# Check scanner directory (should be empty or only show properScanner.ts)
ls -la src/lib/scanner/

# Check dashboard (should not see EnhancedOverviewV2.tsx)
ls -la src/components/dashboard/ | grep Enhanced
```

### Step 3: Test Build
```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Build succeeds with no import errors

### Step 4: Commit Changes
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "chore: remove 9 duplicate files (5 clients, 3 scanners, 1 component)

- Deleted obsolete Polygon clients (kept properClient.ts)
- Deleted obsolete scanners (kept properScanner.ts)
- Deleted obsolete dashboard component (kept EnhancedOverview.tsx)
- All imports verified and working
- Build tested and passing

See DUPLICATE_FILES_CLEANUP_LOG.md for details"
```

## ✅ POST-CLEANUP CHECKLIST

After running the cleanup:

### Verification:
- [ ] All 9 files deleted
- [ ] No files accidentally deleted
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No console errors in dev mode
- [ ] All pages load correctly

### Documentation:
- [ ] Update MASTER_BATTLE_PLAN.md with results
- [ ] Mark cleanup as complete in MASTER_CHAT_HISTORY_INDEX.md
- [ ] Note any issues discovered

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Move to Phase 1B: Build production Polygon client
- [ ] Begin implementing sequential request queue
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging

## 📝 NOTES

### Why This Is Safe:

1. **Import Audit Complete** - We scanned 15+ files for bad imports
2. **One Import Fixed** - EnhancedOverview.tsx was updated before deletion
3. **Active Files Identified** - We know exactly which files are in use
4. **Recent Files Kept** - Keeping the most recent version (Oct 14, 2025)
5. **Build Will Verify** - Running `npm run build` will catch any missed imports

### What Could Go Wrong:

**Scenario:** An import we missed breaks the build  
**Solution:** Git revert and investigate further

**Scenario:** A file we thought was obsolete is actually used  
**Solution:** Git revert specific file and update import audit

**Scenario:** Tests fail after cleanup  
**Solution:** Review test files for imports of deleted files

### Rollback Plan:

If anything goes wrong:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

This will undo the deletion commit and restore all files.
