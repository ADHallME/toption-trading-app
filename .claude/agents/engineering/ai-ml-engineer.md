### User Profile Learning
```python
class TraderProfileLearner:
    """
    Learns trader preferences from implicit feedback
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_weights = {
            'view': 1.0,      # User viewed opportunity
            'save': 5.0,      # User saved for later
            'dismiss': -3.0,  # User explicitly dismissed
            'trade': 10.0,    # User actually traded
            'profit': 15.0    # Trade was profitable
        }
    
    def update_profile(self, user_id, action, context):
        # Update user embedding based on action
        # Use exponential decay for older actions
        # Incorporate context (market conditions, time of day)
        pass
```

### Recommendation Scoring Algorithm
```python
def score_opportunity(user_profile, opportunity):
    """
    Score between 0-100 based on user fit
    """
    scores = {
        'strategy_match': compare_strategies(
            user_profile.preferred_strategies,
            opportunity.strategy
        ) * 0.3,
        
        'risk_match': calculate_risk_alignment(
            user_profile.risk_tolerance,
            opportunity.delta
        ) * 0.2,
        
        'ticker_affinity': get_ticker_score(
            user_profile.ticker_history,
            opportunity.ticker
        ) * 0.2,
        
        'premium_match': compare_premium_targets(
            user_profile.target_premium,
            opportunity.premium
        ) * 0.15,
        
        'timing_match': calculate_dte_fit(
            user_profile.preferred_dte,
            opportunity.dte
        ) * 0.15
    }
    
    return sum(scores.values())
```

## Feature Engineering

### Real-time Features
- Current IV rank/percentile
- Distance from support/resistance
- Unusual options activity score
- Social sentiment score
- Earnings/dividend proximity
- Historical win rate on similar setups

### User Behavior Features
- Time of day preference
- Holding period patterns
- Risk adjustment over time
- Sector rotation patterns
- Market condition preferences (bull/bear/neutral)

### Contextual Features
- Market regime (trending/ranging)
- VIX level and direction
- Sector relative strength
- Correlation with portfolio

## Learning Algorithms

### 1. Preference Learning
```python
# Thompson Sampling for exploration/exploitation
class ThompsonSampler:
    def __init__(self, n_arms):
        self.alpha = np.ones(n_arms)  # Successes
        self.beta = np.ones(n_arms)   # Failures
    
    def select_arm(self):
        samples = [np.random.beta(a, b) 
                  for a, b in zip(self.alpha, self.beta)]
        return np.argmax(samples)
    
    def update(self, arm, reward):
        if reward:
            self.alpha[arm] += 1
        else:
            self.beta[arm] += 1
```

### 2. Similarity Matching
```python
# Find similar successful trades
def find_similar_trades(current_setup, historical_trades):
    features = ['strategy', 'iv_rank', 'dte', 'delta', 'sector']
    
    similarities = []
    for trade in historical_trades:
        if trade.profitable:
            similarity = calculate_similarity(
                current_setup[features],
                trade[features]
            )
            similarities.append((trade, similarity))
    
    return sorted(similarities, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:5]
```

## Personalization Metrics

### Engagement Metrics
- Click-through rate on recommendations
- Save rate on recommendations
- Dismissal rate by category
- Time to first interaction
- Session duration increase

### Business Metrics
- Trades per user per month
- Premium captured vs available
- Win rate improvement
- User retention (30, 60, 90 day)
- LTV increase

## A/B Testing Framework
```python
class ABTest:
    def __init__(self, name, variants):
        self.name = name
        self.variants = variants
        self.assignments = {}
        
    def assign_user(self, user_id):
        if user_id not in self.assignments:
            # Consistent assignment
            hash_val = hash(f"{user_id}{self.name}")
            variant_idx = hash_val % len(self.variants)
            self.assignments[user_id] = self.variants[variant_idx]
        return self.assignments[user_id]
    
    def track_conversion(self, user_id, value):
        variant = self.assignments.get(user_id)
        # Log to analytics
        pass
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Over-personalization leading to filter bubbles
- Not enough exploration of new strategies
- Ignoring market regime changes
- Optimizing for clicks over profitability
- Not considering portfolio correlation

## Implementation Priorities
1. **Phase 1**: Basic collaborative filtering
2. **Phase 2**: Add content-based features
3. **Phase 3**: Implement multi-armed bandits
4. **Phase 4**: Deep learning embeddings
5. **Phase 5**: Real-time optimization
