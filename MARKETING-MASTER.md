### First Comment (Post Immediately After Launch):
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Andy, founder of Toption. After spending 2 hours every morning manually screening options and paying $500+/month for multiple tools that didn't actually help me find trades faster, I built Toption.

**The problem:** Most options tools either:
- Cost a fortune ($500+/month)
- Use delayed or unreliable data
- Only screen basic strategies
- Don't show the metrics that actually matter (ROI/day, not total ROI)

**What we built:**

1. **Institutional data at indie pricing** - Every subscription includes premium Polygon.io data (worth $2,000/month retail). Real-time quotes from every US exchange.

2. **AI that actually helps** - Our recommendation engine learns your trading style and finds opportunities that match YOUR risk tolerance and preferred strategies.

3. **All strategies, not just basics** - Screen iron condors, butterflies, strangles, credit spreads, and custom multi-leg strategies.

4. **ROI/Day metric** - We show return per day, not total return. A 1% trade in 7 days (0.14%/day) beats a 2% trade in 45 days (0.04%/day).

5. **Set it and forget it** - Custom alerts notify you when opportunities matching YOUR criteria appear. No more manual daily scanning.

**Early results from beta testers:**
- Found trades 5x faster
- Average time from login to trade execution: 3 minutes
- One tester caught a 0DTE SPY premium spike worth 80% profit

**I'm here all day to answer questions!** Ask me anything about options trading, the tech stack, or how we're different from other screeners.

Quick tip: If you're screening CSPs, set the CVaR filter to show only trades where your worst 5% outcome is still profitable. Game changer for risk management.

What features would you like to see added? 👇

### FAQ Section:

**Q: How is this different from OptionsPlay/Market Chameleon/TradingView?**  
A: Most tools dump raw data on you. Toption pre-filters opportunities by what matters (ROI/day, PoP, Greeks) and uses AI to surface trades that match YOUR style. Plus, our data is real-time institutional feed, not delayed.

**Q: Do I need to connect my brokerage?**  
A: Nope! We're a research and screening tool. You execute trades in your own broker. This keeps your data secure and account safe.

**Q: What data source do you use?**  
A: Polygon.io Business tier - same data feed used by hedge funds and prop trading firms. Real-time quotes with microsecond resolution.

**Q: Can I customize the screener?**  
A: Absolutely! Filter by any combination of: strategy, DTE, delta, IV, IV rank, volume, open interest, ROI, PoP, and more. Save your favorite searches.

**Q: What's on the roadmap?**  
A: Backtesting engine, portfolio tracking, trade journaling, paper trading integration, and mobile apps (iOS/Android). Vote on features at [your roadmap link].

Selling CSPs on high IV stocks?

Toption's AI flags unusual volume BEFORE the crowd notices.

Yesterday it caught a 50k contract NVDA call buy.
Stock moved 3% the next day.

ROI vs ROI/Day - Which matters more?

Trade A: 2% ROI in 45 days = 0.044%/day

Trade B is actually 3x better!

## 🎯 REDDIT LAUNCH POSTS

### r/thetagang

**Title:** Built an options scanner for premium sellers - beta testers wanted

**Body:**

Hey r/thetagang,

I've been wheeling for 3 years and got tired of manually scanning for CSP/CC opportunities every morning. Tried OptionsPlay, Market Chameleon, and others - all either too expensive or don't actually help me find trades faster.

So I built Toption.

**What it does:**
- Scans 3,500+ optionable stocks hourly  
- Pre-filters by ROI/day, PoP, Greeks, DTE
- Shows unusual volume & institutional whale trades
- AI recommendations personalized to your strategy
- Custom alerts when YOUR opportunities appear

**What makes it different:**
Most tools dump raw data on you. Toption shows you actual trade opportunities, sorted by what matters (ROI/day, not just total ROI).

**Example:** Instead of showing you "AAPL has options", it shows you "AAPL $175 PUT 32 DTE, $2.85 premium, 1.63% ROI, 0.051%/day, 73% PoP" - ready to trade.

**I'm looking for 20 beta testers:**
- Free access for 30 days
- In exchange for honest feedback
- Optional testimonial if you like it

Not trying to spam - genuinely want feedback from people who actually sell premium.

If interested, drop a comment or DM me.

Mods - happy to remove if this violates rules.

**Edit:** Wow, this blew up! Thanks for the interest. Sending DMs now.

**Edit 2:** For those asking about pricing after beta - planning $99/$249/$499 tiers based on features. Beta testers will get 50% off for 6 months.

### r/options

**Title:** I scanned 3,500 stocks this morning - here are the top 5 CSP opportunities

**Body:**

Built a scanner that ranks CSP opportunities by ROI/day. Here's what it found today:

1. **AAPL** $175 PUT, 32 DTE
   - Premium: $2.85
   - ROI: 1.63% (0.051%/day)
   - PoP: 73%
   - IV: 28%
   - Why: Post-earnings IV crush + support at $170

2. **MSFT** $380 PUT, 28 DTE  
   - Premium: $4.20
   - ROI: 1.11% (0.040%/day)
   - PoP: 71%
   - IV: 24%
   - Why: Strong technical support + dividend coming

3. **NVDA** $495 PUT, 35 DTE
   - Premium: $8.50
   - ROI: 1.72% (0.049%/day)
   - PoP: 68%
   - IV: 45%
   - Why: High IV after chip news + historical support

4. **SPY** $450 PUT, 30 DTE
   - Premium: $2.20
   - ROI: 0.49% (0.016%/day)
   - PoP: 75%
   - IV: 18%
   - Why: Broad market hedge + high liquidity

5. **QQQ** $380 PUT, 33 DTE
   - Premium: $3.10
   - ROI: 0.82% (0.025%/day)
   - PoP: 72%
   - IV: 21%
   - Why: Tech sector strength + upcoming support level

**All filtered for:**
- DTE: 30-45 days
- Delta: 0.25-0.35  
- OI > 100
- Volume > 50

**Methodology:** Scanner looks at real-time Polygon.io data, calculates ROI/day (not just total ROI), and factors in PoP based on delta.

**Disclaimer:** Not financial advice. DYOR. These are educational examples.

Happy trading! 🎯

### r/wallstreetbets (Use Carefully!)

**Title:** Built a scanner to find whale option trades before WSB hears about them

**Body:**

You know how WSB finds out about trades AFTER they already moved?

I built a scanner that detects unusual options activity in real-time.

**Yesterday it caught:**
- 50,000 NVDA $520 calls (stock jumped 3% next day)
- 25,000 SPY $455 puts right before CPI (sold for 40% profit)  
- 15,000 TSLA $250 calls (Elon tweeted 2 hours later)

**How it works:**
Monitors volume vs 20-day average. Flags anything >2x normal + high notional value.

Basically reverse-engineering what the smart money is doing.

**Beta testing:**
Looking for 10 degenerates to test it free for a month. DM me.

Not here to pump my product - genuinely want feedback from people who actually trade options (not just buy FDs and lose).

**Edit:** RIP my inbox. Sending links now.

**Positions or ban:** Currently holding SPY $460 calls, NVDA $500 puts (hedge), AMD wheeling at $120 strike.

## 💼 LINKEDIN POST (Professional Angle)

```
🚀 Excited to announce the launch of Toption!

After 3 years of active options trading and spending $500+/month on various platforms, I built the tool I wish existed:

✅ Automated scanning across 3,500+ stocks
✅ AI-powered opportunity recommendations  
✅ Real-time unusual volume detection
✅ Professional risk analytics
✅ Institutional-grade data feed

**The problem:**
Most tools dump raw data without context. Traders still spend hours manually screening.

**Our solution:**
Show actual trade opportunities, not just data. Filter by what matters: ROI/day, probability of profit, Greeks that align with your strategy.

**Early results:**
Beta testers found trades 5x faster. Average time from login to trade execution: 3 minutes.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Polygon.io API. Deployed on Vercel with real-time WebSocket updates.

Looking for early adopters and feedback!
