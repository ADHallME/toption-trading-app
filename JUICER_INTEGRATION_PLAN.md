## MARKETING ANGLE:

"We don't just show you options opportunities - we show you WHO'S BUYING and WHY. 
Sell premium when retail is most euphoric. Our AI tracks 100,000+ social posts daily 
to identify sentiment extremes BEFORE the premium spike."

## LAUNCH MESSAGE:

"Toption is the ONLY options platform that combines:
✅ Full market scanning (1000+ stocks)
✅ Real-time social sentiment from Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits
✅ AI that identifies when retail is about to pump premiums
✅ One-click opportunities when 'dumb money' enters"

## THE KILLER FEATURE:

**"Sentiment Divergence Alerts"**
- When social sentiment is 90% bullish but IV is low = SELL CALLS
- When Reddit panic sells but IV spikes = SELL PUTS
- When WSB discovers a stock = IV EXPANSION INCOMING

## CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS:

1. **Sentiment Heatmap** - Which stocks have highest social activity
2. **Influencer Tracker** - When big accounts mention tickers
3. **Pump Detection** - Unusual social volume = premium opportunity
4. **Fear/Greed by Stock** - Overlay on options chain
5. **"Retail vs Smart Money"** - Compare social sentiment vs option flow

## ROI JUSTIFICATION:

"One sentiment-based trade pays for a YEAR of subscription:
- Spot retail euphoria → Sell calls → Collect inflated premium
- See panic selling → Sell puts → Harvest fear premium
- Detect pump & dump → Sell both sides → Profit from volatility"

## REMEMBER THIS FOR LAUNCH:

Juicer isn't just a "nice to have" - it's your DIFFERENTIATION:
- ThinkorSwim doesn't have social sentiment
- OptionStrat doesn't track retail behavior  
- Market Chameleon doesn't show WHO is buying

You're not selling a screener.
You're selling INTELLIGENCE about the other side of the trade.

"Know your buyer, maximize your premium."
