# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Server-side scanning for ALL optionable equities

BREAKING CHANGE: Moved scanning from client to server

- Scans ALL ~3,500 optionable US equities every 5 mins
- Client fetches cached results (instant <1s load)
- Added Vercel cron job for automated scanning
- No more rate limit issues
- Infinitely scalable (1 user vs 1000 = same load)
- Added footer status bar with scan freshness

Technical details:
- New ServerOpportunityScanner service
- API route /api/opportunities for cached data
- Cron job /api/cron/scan-opportunities
- Batched API calls (20/batch, 4s delay = respects rate limits)
- In-memory caching (will move to Redis for production)

User experience:
- Dashboard loads instantly (no 3-min wait)
- Shows 'Last scan: X mins ago'
- Auto-refreshes every 30s
- Green/Amber/Red status indicator

Deployment:
1. Set CRON_SECRET in Vercel env vars
2. Enable cron job in Vercel dashboard
3. First scan takes 3-4 mins, then instant forever"

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT NEXT STEPS:"

echo "1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables"
echo "   Add: CRON_SECRET=\$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
echo ""
echo "2. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Cron Jobs"
echo "   Verify /api/cron/scan-opportunities is enabled"

echo "3. Wait 3-4 minutes for first scan, or trigger manually:"
echo "   curl -X POST https://www.toptiontrade.com/api/opportunities"
echo ""
echo "4. Check Vercel logs for [SERVER SCAN] messages"
echo ""
echo "5. Visit dashboard: https://www.toptiontrade.com/dashboard"
echo "   Should show 'Tickers Scanned: ~3,500'"

echo "📊 Expected Polygon API usage:"
echo "   - ~3,500 requests per scan"
echo "   - 288 scans per day (every 5 mins)"
echo "   - ~1M requests/day total"
echo "   - Requires Polygon Developer plan (\$99/mo unlimited)"

echo "🎯 To reduce API usage, adjust scan frequency in vercel.json"
echo "   Current: */5 * * * * (every 5 mins)"
echo "   Options: */15 (15m), */30 (30m), 0 * (hourly)"
