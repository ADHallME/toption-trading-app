# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "feat: Integrate REAL Polygon options data with full calculations

MAJOR CHANGES:
- Fixed API to call Polygon snapshot endpoint for real bid/ask prices
- Added all missing calculations:
  * Probability of Profit (PoP) using delta as proxy
  * ROI and ROI/Day calculations from actual premiums
  * Distance from strike calculation
  * Break-even price calculation
  * Annualized returns
- Enhanced screener to display real options data
- Added Greeks display (delta, theta, gamma, vega)
- Added expandable rows for detailed option info
- Implemented proper sorting and filtering
- Added fallback to contracts endpoint with individual quote fetching

This finally connects the \$2000/month Polygon API properly!"
