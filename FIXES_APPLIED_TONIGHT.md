# FIXES APPLIED - October 1, 2025 (9:15 PM)

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED:

### 1. opportunitiesService.ts (Data Generation)
- **Line 54**: Doubled opportunities per symbol from 2-4 to 4-8
- **Line 70-72**: Lowered category thresholds for realism:
  - Market Movers: 1.0% ‚Üí 0.3% ROI/day  
  - High IV: 0.5% ‚Üí 0.15% ROI/day
- **Line 105-110**: Adjusted strategy thresholds:
  - Short Iron Condor: 0.8% ‚Üí 0.25%
  - High Premium Put: 1.0% ‚Üí 0.3%
  - Put Credit Spread: 0.5% ‚Üí 0.15%
  - Iron Condor: 0.3% ‚Üí 0.08%

### 2. OptionsScreenerEnhanced.tsx (Default Tickers)
- **Line 151**: Changed `defaultTickers` from `getDefaultTickers(marketType)` to `[]`
- **Comment added**: "Empty by default - users search entire market"

## üîß STILL NEED TO FIX:

### 1. Quick Add Section - LOCATION UNKNOWN
- **Status**: Could not locate in OptionsScreenerEnhanced.tsx
- **Search pattern**: "Quick Add", "quick", "add", "popular", "suggested"
- **File is 1200+ lines** - may need to search other components

### 2. Main Dashboard Opportunities
- May still be using old default tickers
- Need to verify OpportunitiesFinal.tsx and EnhancedOverview.tsx

### 3. View More Details Section
- User wants it to look like screener column headers
- Entire row should be clickable
- Missing star for watchlist

### 4. Option Type Filter
- Should only show for multi-leg strategies
- Hide for Cash Secured Put (obviously only uses puts)

### 5. Asset Class Tab Filtering
- Fuzzy search not filtering by active tab
- Equities tab should only show stocks/ETFs
- Futures tab should only show futures
- Index tab should only show indexes

## üìã DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
- **Local changes saved**: Yes
- **Git committed**: NO - waiting to batch all fixes
- **Vercel deployed**: NO - will deploy after Quick Add removal

## üéØ NEXT STEPS:
1. Find and remove Quick Add section
2. Test that empty default tickers work
3. Verify opportunities show higher ROI
4. Deploy all fixes together
5. Check live site for improvements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è USER FEEDBACK:
"I just had a realization. I think everything on the main page also has the same default stock tickers that the screener did and thats why it's showing really low ROI opportunities. 100% guarentee theres better opportunities than this right now."

Translation: The data generation changes should help, but we also need to ensure the main dashboard isn't limited to the same old default tickers.

## üîç FILES TO CHECK NEXT:
- OpportunitiesFinal.tsx
- EnhancedOverview.tsx  
- ProfessionalTerminal.tsx
- Any component rendering the main opportunities grid
