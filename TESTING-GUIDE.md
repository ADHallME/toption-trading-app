# üß™ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING GUIDE - TOPTION PART 6

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DUMMY DATA ISSUES (From Past Work)

Based on past chats, here's what was fixed and what to check:

### ‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. **Removed sample-data.ts** - All dummy data deleted
2. **Real Polygon Integration** - Connected to actual API
3. **Minimum filtering** - OI > 10, ROI/day calculated properly
4. **3,500+ ticker scanning** - Full US optionable universe (not just 50 stocks)
5. **Asset class tabs** - Equities, Indexes, Futures working

### ‚ùå POTENTIAL REMAINING ISSUES TO TEST:

## üìã DETAILED TESTING CHECKLIST

### 1. **DATA QUALITY TEST** (MOST CRITICAL!)

Go to: https://toptiontrade.com/dashboard

**Check Opportunities Section:**
- [ ] Do you see REAL ticker symbols (not OPEN, LDI, LUMN hardcoded)?
- [ ] Are ROI values realistic (not all 15% or all 0%)?
- [ ] Is IV showing real percentages (not 0% or 85% for everything)?
- [ ] Does Volume show real numbers (not 0 or fake round numbers)?
- [ ] Does Open Interest look real (varied, not all 100)?

**If you see:**
- ‚ùå Same 3-5 tickers every time ‚Üí Hardcoded data still there
- ‚ùå All IV = 0% ‚Üí API not returning Greeks
- ‚ùå All Volume/OI = 0 ‚Üí API not connected
- ‚úÖ Different tickers, varied IV/Vol/OI ‚Üí REAL DATA! üéâ

### 2. **ALERT SYSTEM TEST**

**Create an Alert:**
1. Go to Alert Settings
2. Create new alert:
   - Name: "Test High ROI"
   - Strategy: Wheel
   - Min ROI: 5%
   - Min PoP: 70%
3. Save

- [ ] Actionable insights present ("This trade is good because...")?
- [ ] Scores make sense (high ROI = high score)?
- [ ] Different opportunities have different scores (not all 85)?

### 4. **SCREENER TEST**

2. **/api/alerts/list** - Should return your alerts
3. **/api/recommendations** - Should return AI scores
