# CRITICAL FIXES TO APPLY - October 1, 2025 8:30 PM

## Issues to Fix:

### 1. âœ… BUILD ERROR (FIXED)
- Changed `import AnalyticsTab from './AnalyticsTab'` to `import { AnalyticsTab } from './AnalyticsTab'`
- Build should now succeed

### 2. ðŸ”§ QUICK ADD SECTION
- User reports it's still visible (see screenshot)
- Located in OptionsScreenerEnhanced.tsx
- Must be removed entirely

### 3. ðŸ”§ DEFAULT TICKERS
- Don't pre-populate with 10 tickers
- Default should be EMPTY or entire US market searchable
- Let users search and add what they want

### 4. ðŸ”§ OPTION TYPE FILTER
- Currently shows "Call/Put/Both" always
- Should only show for multi-leg strategies (Iron Condor, Straddle, Strangle)
- Confusing for single-leg strategies

### 5. ðŸ”§ FUZZY SEARCH
- Should filter by active asset class tab
- Equities tab = only show stocks/ETFs
- Futures tab = only show futures
- Currently showing all assets

## User's Core Feedback:
> "Wouldn't you do that to be able to get familiar with and trust a new data tool? I mean that's a lot of the way I will personally use this for my own trading."

**Translation**: Make screener work like Google:
1. User arrives
2. User types query
3. Instant results
4. User refines search
5. User finds what they want

Not: Pre-populate, force choices, limit options

## Style Reminder:
- DON'T change UI/UX
- DON'T reinvent layouts
- Keep existing styling
- User spent forever on current design
