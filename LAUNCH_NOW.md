## 📝 Reddit Launch Post Template

**Title**: Built an AI options scanner that actually finds the top 1% of trades - giving away 50 founder accounts at 50% off

**Post**:
Hey theta gang,

I got tired of spending hours every morning manually screening for wheel opportunities, so I built something that does it automatically.

**What it does:**
- Scans 1000+ optionable stocks (not just SPY/QQQ)
- AI scores each opportunity based on ROI, liquidity, and risk
- Sends alerts when your criteria are met
- Shows historical performance and anomalies
- Calculates dividend-adjusted returns for covered calls

**Why it's different:**
Most scanners just filter by basic parameters. This uses AI to find unusual activity and opportunities that humans miss. Found a 47% annualized return on XYZ yesterday that I never would have spotted manually.

**The offer:**
First 50 people get 50% off for 6 months with code FOUNDER50. After 14-day free trial.

Not trying to spam - built this for myself and figured others might find it useful. Happy to answer any questions about the methodology.

## 💰 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario:
- Day 1: 10 trials → 3 paid = $297 MRR
- Week 1: 50 trials → 15 paid = $1,485 MRR
- Month 1: 200 trials → 50 paid = $4,950 MRR
- Month 3: 500 users = $15,000 MRR

### Break-even: 
20 users × $99 = $1,980 (covers Polygon costs)

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes If Something Breaks

### If Polygon API fails:
```javascript
// Add to src/lib/polygon/client.ts
const FALLBACK_DATA = {
  SPY: { price: 450, options: [...] },
  QQQ: { price: 380, options: [...] }
}

if (!response.ok) {
  console.error('Polygon API failed, using fallback')
  return FALLBACK_DATA[ticker]
}
```

### If Stripe checkout fails:
```javascript
// Temporary: collect emails for manual processing
const collectEmail = async (email, plan) => {
  await fetch('/api/waitlist', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, plan })
  })
  alert('Payment system updating. We\'ll email you within 2 hours!')
}
```

### If site crashes:
```bash
# Quick rollback
vercel rollback

# Or deploy simple holding page
echo "<h1>Toption is updating. Back in 10 minutes.</h1>" > index.html
vercel --prod
```
