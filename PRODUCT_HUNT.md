## First Comment

Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

After getting frustrated with existing options screeners that either cost a fortune or barely worked, I built Toption.

The problem: Most options tools are either:
- Too expensive ($500+/month)
- Using delayed or bad data
- Only screen basic strategies
- Don't show cash requirements

What makes Toption different:

**1. Institutional data included**
Every subscription includes premium Polygon.io data (worth $2,000/month retail). This isn't delayed quotes - it's microsecond-resolution data from every US exchange.

**2. All strategies, not just puts/calls**
Screen iron condors, butterflies, strangles, and custom multi-leg strategies. See exactly how much capital you need.

**3. Risk analytics that matter**
CVaR shows your worst-case scenarios. Sharpe Ratio shows risk-adjusted returns. Kelly Criterion tells you optimal position sizing.

**4. Real-time alerts**
Get notified when premium spikes happen. In options, being 5 minutes late means missing the trade.

**Pricing:**
- Starter: $79/month (100 scans/day)
- Professional: $149/month (unlimited + real-time data)
- Enterprise: $499/month (API access + multiple accounts)

**30-day free trial, no card required.**

For Product Hunters: Use code **PH50** for 50% off your first 3 months.

Built this for myself, but figured other traders might find it useful. Would love your feedback on what features to add next.

**Follow-up Tweet:**
Why I built Toption:

Spent 2 hours every morning screening options. 
Paid $500/month for multiple tools.
Still missed opportunities because of delayed data.

Now: 30-second scans, real-time alerts, one tool.

The math: One good trade = year of subscription

## Hunter's Comment
Been using this for my own trading for 3 months. Caught a 0DTE SPY put premium spike from $2.10 to $3.85 in under 2 minutes yesterday. The alerts alone paid for the year.

Quick tip: If you're screening CSPs, set the CVaR filter to show only trades where your worst 5% outcome is still profitable. Game changer for risk management.
