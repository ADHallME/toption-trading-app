## 📱 MOBILE APP INFO:

**You DON'T have a native app yet!**

What you have:
- ✅ Mobile-responsive website (works on phones)
- ✅ PWA (can add to home screen)
- ❌ NOT in App Store yet

To test "mobile app":
1. Open https://toptiontrade.com on your phone
2. It will work like an app
3. You can "Add to Home Screen" (looks like native app)

To get in App Stores (later):
- Need React Native wrapper ($99/year Apple, $25 Google)
- Takes 2-4 weeks after web launch
- Let's nail the web version first!
