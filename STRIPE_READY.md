## üì¢ LAUNCH MESSAGE FOR REDDIT:

```
Title: Built an AI options scanner that finds opportunities across 1000+ stocks - 50 founder accounts at 50% off

Hey theta gang,

Got tired of manually scanning for wheel opportunities every morning. Built something that:

‚Ä¢ Scans entire market (not just SPY/QQQ)
‚Ä¢ AI scores each opportunity 
‚Ä¢ Sends alerts when criteria met
‚Ä¢ Shows historical performance

Found a 47% annualized put yesterday that I never would've spotted.

First 50 users: FOUNDER50 for 50% off (after 14-day trial)

https://toption-app.vercel.app

Happy to answer questions about the methodology!
```

## üí∞ QUICK MATH:
- Polygon costs: $2,000/month
- Break-even: 20 users √ó $99 = $1,980
- With FOUNDER50: 40 users needed
- Goal: 100 users = $9,900 MRR
